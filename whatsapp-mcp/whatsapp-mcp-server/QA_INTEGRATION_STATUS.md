### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Auto-calculated fields using PostgreSQL generated columns
completed_photos INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS (sum of true steps) STORED
outstanding_photos INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS (14 - completed_photos) STORED

-- Unique constraint prevents duplicate reviews
UNIQUE(drop_number, review_date)
```

#### Integration Code
```python
# In realtime_drop_monitor.py
def create_qa_photo_review(drop_number, contractor_name, dry_run=False):
    # Creates QA review with all 14 steps defaulting to FALSE
    # Extracts user from WhatsApp contractor name
    # Auto-timestamps and adds creation comment
```

### ✅ **Next Steps Available**

#### Immediate Enhancements
- Photo upload integration for each QA step
- Advanced filtering (date ranges, completion status)
- Export functionality to Excel format
- Bulk operations for multiple drops
- Email/SMS notifications for incomplete reviews

#### System Extensions
