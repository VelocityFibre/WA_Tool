# WhatsApp MCP Server Changelog

## [2025-09-26] - Drop Monitor Troubleshooting & Manual Processing

### Issues Resolved
- **Drop Monitor State Management**: Fixed issue where monitor state file prevented processing of historical messages
- **Manual Processing Capability**: Developed scripts for manually processing missed drop numbers
- **WhatsApp Bridge Compatibility**: Updated whatsmeow library dependencies and fixed API compatibility issues

### What Happened
On 2025-09-26, three drop numbers (DR1750828, DR1748821, DR1751093) were posted to the Lawley Activation 3 WhatsApp group between 11:01-11:04, but the automatic drop monitor failed to process them into the Neon database.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **WhatsApp Bridge Downtime**: The Go bridge was not running when the messages arrived
2. **State File Issues**: Monitor state prevented processing of messages from before the monitor restart time
3. **API Compatibility**: Updated whatsmeow library required context parameters for function calls

### Actions Taken

#### 1. WhatsApp Bridge Fixes
- Updated whatsmeow library to latest version (2025-09-22)
- Fixed API compatibility issues in `main.go`:
  - Added context parameters to `client.Download()` calls
  - Added context parameters to `sqlstore.New()` calls  
  - Added context parameters to `container.GetFirstDevice()` calls
  - Added context parameters to `client.Store.Contacts.GetContact()` calls
- Successfully built and deployed updated bridge

#### 2. Manual Processing Implementation
Developed comprehensive manual processing scripts to handle missed drop numbers:

**Verification Process**:
- Check WhatsApp SQLite database for message presence
- Verify Neon database for existing installation records
- Cross-reference to identify processing gaps

**Manual Processing**:
- Extract message details (sender, timestamp, content)  
- Create installation records with proper contractor identification
- Generate QA photo review checklists with 14 verification steps
- Handle database constraints and generated columns correctly

#### 3. System Monitoring Improvements
- Added system status verification scripts
- Documented state file management procedures
- Created troubleshooting guides for future incidents

### Results
- âœ… **DR1750828**: Installation ID 32 + QA Review ID bc2fa0c6-6b2d-4925-9f21-ba961561f2ae
- âœ… **DR1748821**: Installation ID 33 + QA Review ID 1654632c-850d-43bb-a392-3f7c77a69eee  
- âœ… **DR1751093**: Installation ID 34 + QA Review ID ad05c83e-720c-414f-b58f-6f4655ab5491

All three drop numbers are now fully integrated into the QA workflow system.

### System Status (Post-Fix)
- ðŸ“¡ WhatsApp Bridge: âœ… Running with updated dependencies
- ðŸ¤– Drop Monitor: âœ… Active and processing (15-second intervals)  
- ðŸ’¾ Database: âœ… Both SQLite and Neon connections stable
- ðŸ”„ Automatic Processing: âœ… Functional for new messages

### Documentation Updates
- Updated WARP.md with troubleshooting procedures
- Added manual processing scripts for future use
- Documented system status verification commands

### Prevention Measures
- Improved monitor state management
- Added system health check procedures
- Documented manual processing workflows for edge cases

### Technical Improvements
- **Dependencies Updated**: whatsmeow library to v0.0.0-20250922112717-258fd9454b95
- **API Modernization**: Updated function calls to use context parameters
- **Error Handling**: Improved database constraint handling for manual processing
- **State Management**: Better understanding and control of monitor state files

### Future Recommendations
1. Implement health checks to ensure bridge stays running
2. Add automated alerting when messages are not processed within expected timeframes  
3. Consider implementing a retry mechanism for failed processing attempts
4. Add monitoring dashboard for system component status

**Note**: This incident highlighted the importance of both the WhatsApp bridge stability and proper state management in the drop monitoring system. The manual processing capability developed provides a reliable fallback for similar situations in the future.
